## API Endpoints

The bot integrates with these APIs:

- **OpenAI API**: For generating intelligent responses
- **WhatsApp Cloud API**: For sending messages
- **Meta Graph API**: For WhatsApp Business features

## Customization Examples

### Adding New Response Types

```javascript
async function handleCustomQuery(customerName, qaData, phoneNumberId, whatsappToken, customerPhone) {
  const response = await generateIntelligentResponse("Your custom query", customerName, qaData);
  await sendWhatsAppTextMessage(response, phoneNumberId, whatsappToken, customerPhone);
}
```

### Modifying Response Templates

Edit the `response_templates` section in `customer_service_qa.json`:

```json
{
  "response_templates": {
    "custom_greeting": "Hello {customer_name}! Welcome to {business_name}..."
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

The bot includes comprehensive error handling:

- API failures fall back to direct contact information
- Invalid responses trigger fallback messages
- Network issues are logged and handled gracefully

## Security Considerations

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting for API calls
- Validate customer phone numbers
- Monitor API usage and costs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WhatsApp API Errors**
   - Verify your token and phone number ID
   - Check API permissions in Meta Developer Console
   - Ensure your WhatsApp Business account is active

2. **OpenAI API Errors**
   - Verify your API key
   - Check your OpenAI account balance
   - Monitor rate limits

3. **Message Not Sending**
